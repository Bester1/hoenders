# Epic and Story Structure

## Epic Approach

**Epic Structure Decision**: Single comprehensive epic with rationale

For this customer portal enhancement, I recommend a **single epic approach** because:

1. **Cohesive Feature**: All customer portal components are tightly integrated and interdependent
2. **Shared Infrastructure**: Customer authentication, data models, and UI components work together as one system
3. **Risk Management**: Single epic allows for coordinated rollback if issues arise
4. **Brownfield Integration**: All stories must work together to maintain existing system integrity

This structure ensures the customer portal is delivered as a complete, functional unit while maintaining your existing admin dashboard functionality.
