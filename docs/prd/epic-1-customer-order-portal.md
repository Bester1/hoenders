## Development Implementation Strategy

### **Optimal Development Sequence for Dev Team**

**Phase 1: Core Foundation (Stories 1.1-1.3)**
- Complete customer authentication and portal framework first
- Product catalog integration with existing pricing system
- **Deliverable**: Customers can register, login, and browse products

**Phase 2: Standard Ordering (Story 1.4 - Standard cart only)**
- Implement single-person ordering functionality first  
- Focus on cart mechanics and basic order placement
- **Deliverable**: Customers can place individual orders

**Phase 3: Email Integration (Story 1.5 - Standard orders only)**
- Connect standard orders to existing email system
- Validate invoice generation and email delivery
- **Deliverable**: Standard orders send confirmation emails

**Phase 4: Order History (Story 1.6 - Standard orders only)**
- Build order history for individual orders first
- Customer profile management (Story 1.7)
- **Deliverable**: Complete individual customer experience

**Phase 5: Group Ordering Enhancement (Stories 1.4B, 1.5, 1.6 enhancements)**
- Add multi-person coordinator functionality to proven foundation
- Extend email system for multiple invoice attachments
- Enhance order history for group order display
- **Deliverable**: Full multi-person coordinator capability

### **Key Integration Points**

**Database Schema Extensions Required**:
```sql
-- Extend existing orders table
ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN order_type VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'standard'; -- 'standard' | 'group'
ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN coordinator_id INTEGER REFERENCES customers(id);
ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN group_order_id VARCHAR(50); -- Link related group participants

-- New table for group order participants  
CREATE TABLE group_order_participants (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    group_order_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    participant_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    participant_email VARCHAR(100), -- Optional, coordinator gets invoices
    order_data JSONB NOT NULL, -- Individual order items
    invoice_generated BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Admin Dashboard Integration Points**:
- Order table needs "Group Order" indicator with expandable participant view
- Email queue must handle multiple PDF attachments per email
- Invoice generation system extends to create multiple invoices per order
- Analytics must account for group orders (count participants vs orders)

**Customer Portal UI Components Required**:
- Group order toggle switch in cart interface
- Dynamic "Add Person" functionality with form validation
- Participant management (add/remove/edit participants)
- Group order confirmation display with person-by-person breakdown
- Group order history with expandable participant details

**Email System Extensions**:
- Multiple PDF generation per order
- Email attachment bundling (max 25MB limit handling)
- Group order confirmation template with summary + individual invoice attachments
- Proper attachment naming convention for easy distribution

### **Risk Mitigation & Testing Strategy**

**Backward Compatibility**:
- All existing admin functionality must remain unchanged
- Existing single orders continue to work exactly as before
- Database changes are additive only, no breaking changes

**Performance Considerations**:
- Group orders limited to 10 people maximum to prevent system abuse
- Email attachment size monitoring (individual PDF generation optimization)
- Database indexing on group_order_id for efficient queries

**Quality Assurance Focus Areas**:
1. **Integration Testing**: Admin dashboard continues working with new database schema
2. **Email Testing**: Multiple PDF attachment delivery reliability
3. **User Experience Testing**: Group ordering workflow is intuitive and error-free
4. **Performance Testing**: Large group orders don't impact system performance
5. **Security Testing**: Customer data isolation maintained in group orders
