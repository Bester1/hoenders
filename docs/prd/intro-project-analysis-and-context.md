# Intro Project Analysis and Context

## Existing Project Overview

**Analysis Source**: IDE-based fresh analysis + QA review conducted

**Current Project State**: 
Plaas Hoenders is a comprehensive admin dashboard for managing chicken orders, invoicing, and email communications. The system processes butchery PDF invoices using AI/OCR, manages customer orders through imports, generates professional invoices, and handles email communications via Google Apps Script. The application features a Business Intelligence dashboard, pricing management, and dual-layer data persistence (Supabase + localStorage).

## Available Documentation Analysis

**Using existing technical documentation** from comprehensive QA analysis and CLAUDE.md project documentation:

✅ **Available Documentation**:
- [x] Tech Stack Documentation (Vanilla JS, HTML/CSS, Supabase, Google Apps Script)
- [x] Source Tree/Architecture (Modular SPA with section-based navigation)  
- [x] Coding Standards (Clean separation of concerns, modular functions)
- [x] API Documentation (Google Apps Script integration, Supabase schema)
- [x] External API Documentation (PDF.js, Tesseract.js OCR pipeline)
- [ ] UX/UI Guidelines (Professional admin interface but no formal guidelines)
- [x] Technical Debt Documentation (Low technical debt, mostly debug logging cleanup needed)

## Enhancement Scope Definition

**Enhancement Type**:
- [x] New Feature Addition (Customer portal)
- [x] Integration with New Systems (Customer authentication, order tracking)

**Enhancement Description**: 
Adding a customer-facing order portal that allows customers to place orders directly, track order status, view order history, and manage their account preferences. This will integrate with the existing admin dashboard while providing a separate customer interface.

**Impact Assessment**:
- [x] Moderate Impact (some existing code changes for customer data model extensions)

## Goals and Background Context

**Goals**:
• Enable customers to place orders directly without admin intervention
• Provide customers with real-time order tracking and history
• Reduce administrative workload through customer self-service
• Integrate seamlessly with existing butchery workflow and invoice system
• Maintain all existing admin dashboard functionality

**Background Context**: 
Currently, all orders are processed through the admin dashboard via CSV imports or PDF analysis from butchery invoices. Customers have no direct interaction with the system and must place orders through phone calls or messages. This creates administrative bottlenecks and lacks modern e-commerce conveniences that customers expect. The customer portal will complement the existing butchery-to-invoice workflow while enabling direct customer engagement.
