## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: 1.6.customer-order-history-and-tracking.md#completion-notes]
- Customer portal infrastructure fully implemented with authentication and session management
- Customer data structure already established with customer.id, name, email, phone, address fields
- Database integration patterns working with Supabase real-time and localStorage fallback
- Customer authentication via JWT tokens stored in localStorage functioning properly
- Existing customer profile data loading in loadCustomerProfile() function (customer.js:130-133)
- Real-time subscription setup already implemented for customer data updates

### Database Schema Context  
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md#customers + customer-sessions]
- Customers table includes id, auth_user_id, name, email, phone, address, communication_preferences (JSONB)
- Row Level Security policies ensure customers can only update own profile data
- Updated_at trigger automatically timestamps profile changes
- Customer_sessions table tracks authentication and security events
- Communication_preferences stored as JSONB with default {"email_notifications": true}
- Customer matching function match_customer_orders() maintains order history linkage

### Customer Data Model Context
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#customer]
- Customer model: customerId (UUID), email (unique), name, phone, address, communicationPreferences (JSON)
- Customer.isActive boolean for account deletion (soft delete pattern)
- Customer.lastLogin timestamp updated on profile access
- Communication preferences: emailNotifications, delivery instructions, contact preferences
- Profile updates must maintain referential integrity with existing orders

### Authentication Architecture Context
[Source: architecture/components.md#authentication-service-component]
- Supabase Auth integration for password management and verification
- JWT token management with localStorage session persistence
- Customer session validation and refresh patterns established  
- Password change requires current password verification for security
- Session management includes IP tracking and user agent logging

### Customer Portal UI Context
[Source: architecture/components.md#customer-portal-component + source-tree.md]
- Customer portal entry point: customer.html with navigation structure
- Customer portal JavaScript: customer.js with existing authentication functions
- Shared UI components and CSS styling patterns from admin dashboard
- Profile management interface integration with existing portal navigation
- Responsive design requirements for mobile profile management

### Security and Validation Context
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules + database-schema.md#row-level-security]
- Customer data isolation mandatory - customers can only access/modify own profiles
- Row Level Security policies enforce profile update restrictions
- JWT session validation required before profile modifications
- Form validation patterns: email format, phone format, required fields
- Password strength validation minimum 8 characters with complexity

### Email System Integration Context  
[Source: architecture/components.md#email-service-component]
- Profile updates must integrate with existing Google Apps Script email system
- Communication preferences affect future order confirmation emails
- Email address changes must preserve existing email queue functionality
- Profile changes trigger email preference updates in email queue customer data

### File Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- customer.js: Add profile management functions alongside existing authentication code
- customer.html: Extend navigation to include Profile section
- shared-utils.js: Common form validation utilities if needed
- styles.css: Profile form styling consistent with existing customer portal design

### Form Validation Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]
- Client-side validation with real-time feedback patterns
- Email format validation using existing admin dashboard patterns
- South African phone number format validation
- Required field validation with user-friendly error messages
- Form submission prevention until all validation passes

### Integration with Order System
[Source: 1.6 completion notes + architecture/data-models.md#order-extended]
- Profile updates must reflect in future order.customerName, customerEmail, customerPhone, customerAddress
- Customer.id foreign key relationship with orders must be preserved
- Historical order linkage via match_customer_orders() function must remain intact
- Admin dashboard customer views must show updated profile information

### Testing Requirements  
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]
- Manual testing through browser console with customer authentication
- Profile update integration testing with order placement workflow
- Password change security testing with invalid current password attempts
- Communication preference integration with email queue functionality
- Account deletion testing with order history preservation verification

### Performance Considerations
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md#customer-order-summary]
- Customer profile updates trigger updated_at timestamp for audit trails
- Customer_order_summary materialized view may need refresh after profile changes
- Profile form should load current data efficiently without unnecessary database calls
- Real-time profile updates should not impact existing customer portal performance

## Testing

### Manual Testing Requirements
- Test profile form loads with current customer data correctly
- Verify email address change updates future order confirmations
- Test password change with valid and invalid current passwords
- Validate communication preference changes affect email notifications
- Ensure account deletion preserves order history while preventing login
- Test form validation displays appropriate error messages
- Verify profile updates integrate with admin customer management views

### Integration Testing
- Profile updates → New order placement → Updated customer details in orders
- Email address change → Email queue integration → Proper recipient addressing
- Communication preference changes → Order confirmation emails → Preference compliance
- Account deletion → Admin order history access → Data preservation verification
- Profile form validation → User experience → Error handling and success messaging
