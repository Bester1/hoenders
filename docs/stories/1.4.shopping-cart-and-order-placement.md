# Story 1.4: Shopping Cart and Order Placement

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** customer browsing products,  
**I want** to add items with quantities to a cart and place orders,  
**so that** I can purchase multiple products in a single transaction.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Customer can add products to cart with quantity selection (1, 2, 3+ items)
2. Cart shows running total with individual item calculations (quantity × weight × price/kg)
3. Customer can modify quantities or remove items from cart before ordering
4. Order placement requires confirmation of customer details (delivery address, phone)
5. Successful order generates unique order ID and confirmation message
6. Order data is stored using existing database structure with source="customer_portal"
7. Cart is cleared after successful order placement

**Integration Verification**:
- IV1: Customer orders appear in existing admin dashboard orders table
- IV2: Order numbering system maintains existing sequence without conflicts
- IV3: Customer orders integrate with existing email queue system

- Order table extended with customer_id and source fields for customer portal integration
- OrderItem table structure defined for granular product tracking
- Existing order numbering system to be maintained for admin dashboard compatibility
- Real-time integration patterns established for admin notifications

### File Structure Context
[Source: architecture.md#source-tree]
- customer.js: Customer portal JavaScript to be extended with cart functionality
- shared-utils.js: Common utility functions available for cart calculations
- styles.css: Shared styles to be extended for cart interface design
- Customer portal completely separated from admin files (index.html, script.js)

### Component Architecture
[Source: architecture.md#components]
**Customer Portal Component - Shopping Cart Responsibilities:**
- Shopping cart state management with localStorage persistence
- Cart calculation engine using existing pricing data
- Checkout form with customer profile integration
- Order placement interface with admin dashboard integration
- Cart notification and progress indicators

**Data Access Layer Component - Order Creation:**
- Customer order creation using existing database patterns
- Order item management with product weight calculations
- Integration with admin dashboard real-time notifications
- Email queue integration for order confirmations

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture.md#coding-standards]
- Function naming: camelCase with descriptive actions (`addToCart()`, `calculateCartTotal()`, `placeCustomerOrder()`)
- CSS classes: kebab-case with component prefix (`.cart-sidebar`, `.checkout-form`, `.order-confirmation`)
- JSDoc documentation required for all cart and order functions
- Error handling: Wrap all operations in try/catch with localStorage fallback
- Customer data validation: All cart and order data must be validated before submission

### Database Integration Pattern
[Source: architecture.md#database-schema + existing order structure]
- Use existing orders table structure with new customer_id and source fields
- Create order_items records for detailed product tracking per Epic 1 requirements
- Maintain existing order ID format for admin dashboard compatibility
- Link to customer profile using authenticated customer session data

### Security Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#security + authentication patterns]
- JWT token validation before order placement
- Customer can only place orders for their own account
- Never expose cost price data in cart calculations (use selling prices only)
- Input validation for all cart quantities and customer details
- Order placement rate limiting to prevent abuse

### Integration Constraints
[Source: epic-1-customer-order-portal.md#integration-requirements]
- Preserve ALL existing admin functionality without modification
- Customer orders must appear in admin dashboard with proper source identification
- Utilize existing order processing workflow without architectural changes
- Maintain existing email queue patterns for order confirmations
- Cart interface must integrate seamlessly with existing customer portal navigation

### Mobile Responsiveness Requirements
[Source: 1.3.product-catalog-display.md#mobile-responsiveness]
- Mobile-first cart interface design using established responsive patterns
- Touch-friendly cart controls with proper spacing and tap targets
- Cart sidebar or modal must work across mobile and desktop experiences
- Checkout form optimized for mobile input (large fields, clear labels)
- Follow existing admin dashboard mobile patterns for consistency

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#test-strategy-and-standards]
- Test all cart functions through browser console before integration
- Verify error handling with invalid cart data and network failures
- Validate cart calculations with edge cases (zero quantities, pricing changes)
- Ensure localStorage cart persistence works across browser sessions
- Test order placement integration with existing admin dashboard workflow

### Performance Considerations
- Cart calculations performed client-side for responsive user experience
- LocalStorage cart persistence for offline cart management
- Minimal API calls using existing customer profile and pricing data
- Efficient DOM updates for cart quantity changes and total recalculations
- Proper loading states during order placement process

### Email Integration Pattern
[Source: architecture.md#email-service-component + existing email patterns]
- Use existing Google Apps Script email service for order confirmations
- Extend existing email queue with customer order confirmation templates
- Maintain existing email template structure and Afrikaans language support
- Order confirmation emails include order details, customer information, and delivery timeline

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-08

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Implementation Quality: ✅ EXCELLENT**

The shopping cart and order placement system demonstrates sophisticated JavaScript architecture with:
- Clean separation of concerns between UI, business logic, and data persistence
- Comprehensive JSDoc documentation following professional standards
- Proper error handling with user-friendly Afrikaans feedback messages
- Thoughtful UX design with 4-step wizard, cart persistence, and progressive enhancement
- Integration patterns that maintain existing admin dashboard compatibility

The code follows modern ES6+ practices with proper async/await handling, destructuring, and modular function design.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: customer-portal.js
  - **Change**: Enhanced `setQuantity()` with input validation and XSS protection
  - **Why**: Original function lacked input sanitization and bounds checking
  - **How**: Added productKey sanitization, quantity bounds validation (0-999), and error logging

- **File**: customer-portal.js
  - **Change**: Strengthened `saveCustomerChanges()` with comprehensive validation
  - **Why**: Customer data inputs needed validation and length limits for security
  - **How**: Added phone validation, input sanitization with length limits, replaced alert() with showTempMessage()

- **File**: customer-portal.js
  - **Change**: Rebuilt `saveCartToStorage()` with data integrity validation
  - **Why**: Original lacked cart validation and localStorage quota error handling
  - **How**: Added cart cleanup, quantity validation, quota exceeded handling, and version tracking

- **File**: customer-portal.js
  - **Change**: Completely redesigned `validateOrderData()` with comprehensive security checks
  - **Why**: Simple boolean validation insufficient for production security requirements
  - **How**: Implemented detailed validation with error collection, financial limits, and structured error reporting

- **File**: customer-portal.js
  - **Change**: Optimized `updateCartSummary()` for better DOM performance
  - **Why**: Performance improvement for cart updates and better error handling
  - **How**: Added DOM element caching, early returns, and documentFragment usage

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✅ **EXCELLENT** - JSDoc documentation, camelCase naming, proper error handling patterns
- Project Structure: ✅ **PERFECT** - Files organized per Dev Notes, customer portal isolated from admin
- Testing Strategy: ✅ **ALIGNED** - Manual testing approach implemented with console verification points  
- All ACs Met: ✅ **COMPLETE** - All 7 acceptance criteria fully implemented with Integration Verification

### Improvements Checklist
