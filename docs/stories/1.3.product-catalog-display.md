# Story 1.3: Product Catalog Display

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** authenticated customer,  
**I want** to browse available products with descriptions and pricing,  
**so that** I can make informed ordering decisions.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Customer sees all products from existing pricing catalog with selling prices only
2. Products display with names, descriptions, packaging information, and per-kg pricing
3. Product images or icons are shown for visual identification
4. Products are organized in logical categories (whole chickens, cuts, specialty items)
5. Mobile-friendly product grid layout with touch-friendly interaction
6. Product availability status is clearly indicated
7. Packaging details (vacuum packed, quantity per pack) are prominently displayed

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: 1.2.customer-portal-ui-framework.md#completion-notes]
- Customer portal framework is complete with navigation for Dashboard, Products, Orders, Profile sections
- Product section currently has placeholder content awaiting this story implementation
- Navigation state management and section switching already implemented
- Mobile-responsive design patterns established and working
- Loading states and error handling framework ready for integration

### Architecture Context
[Source: tech-stack.md]
- Frontend Framework: Vanilla JavaScript with ES6+ features for consistency
- CSS Framework: Custom CSS with Grid/Flexbox responsive design patterns
- Icons: FontAwesome 6.0.0 for consistent icon usage across portal
- Database: Supabase with real-time subscription capabilities for dynamic updates
- No additional frameworks - maintain existing vanilla JavaScript approach

### File Structure Context
[Source: source-tree.md]
- customer.html: Customer portal entry point with navigation framework (existing)
- customer.js: Customer portal JavaScript with section management (existing)
- shared-utils.js: Common utility functions available for product operations (existing)
- styles.css: Shared styles to be extended for product catalog (existing)
- Maintain complete separation from admin files (index.html, script.js)

### Component Architecture
[Source: components.md#customer-portal-component]
**Customer Portal Component - Product Catalog Responsibilities:**
- Product catalog display with pricing information from existing pricing data
- Product browsing interface with category organization and search capability
- Visual product identification using icons or images
- Integration with existing portal navigation and authentication systems
- Mobile-responsive grid layout following established design patterns

[Source: components.md#shared-ui-component-library]
- Reuse existing card layouts and responsive grid patterns from admin dashboard
- Utilize established loading states and error handling for product data loading
- Apply consistent FontAwesome icon usage and visual design language
- Maintain existing modal dialog and notification patterns for future cart integration

### Coding Standards
[Source: coding-standards.md]
- Function naming: camelCase with descriptive actions (`displayProducts()`, `filterProductsByCategory()`)
- CSS classes: kebab-case with component prefix (`.product-catalog`, `.product-card`)
- JSDoc documentation required for all public functions
- Error handling: Wrap all operations in try/catch with localStorage fallback
- Customer data isolation: Never expose cost prices from pricing object
- Maintain existing admin functionality: Product changes must not break admin pricing management

### Data Access and Pricing Integration
[Source: Previous story context + existing codebase patterns]
- Existing pricing object structure contains both cost and selling prices
- Product data access pattern: `pricing[productName].selling` for customer display
- Must preserve existing admin access to `pricing[productName].cost` without interference
- Real-time updates: Changes to pricing in admin dashboard should reflect immediately in customer catalog

### Security Requirements
[Source: coding-standards.md#critical-rules + components.md#authentication-service-component]
- JWT token validation before displaying pricing information
- Customer data isolation via established session management patterns
- Never expose cost price data in customer interface
- Input validation for any search or filter functionality
- Maintain existing session timeout and authentication patterns

### Integration Constraints
[Source: epic-1-customer-order-portal.md#integration-requirements + previous story notes]
- Preserve ALL existing admin functionality without modification
- Utilize existing pricing data structure without architectural changes
- Maintain existing Supabase and Google Apps Script infrastructure
- CSS extensions must not impact admin dashboard styling
- Product catalog must integrate seamlessly with existing portal framework from Story 1.2

### Mobile Responsiveness Requirements
[Source: Previous story completion notes + tech-stack.md]
- Mobile-first responsive design approach using existing CSS Grid/Flexbox patterns
- Touch-friendly interface with proper spacing and tap targets
- Responsive product grid that adapts to different screen sizes
- Maintain visual consistency across mobile and desktop experiences
- Follow existing admin dashboard mobile patterns for consistency

### Testing Requirements
[Source: test-strategy-and-standards.md#manual-testing-requirements]
- Test all product display functions through browser console before integration
- Verify error handling with invalid product data and network failures
- Validate responsive design across mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
- Ensure localStorage fallback works when Supabase is unreachable
- Test integration with existing customer portal navigation and authentication

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading for product images if implemented
- Efficient product filtering and categorization algorithms
- Minimal API calls using existing pricing data patterns
- Proper caching strategies following existing admin dashboard patterns

### Security Review

**✓ Security Excellent** - The implementation properly isolates cost pricing data from customer interface while maintaining admin system functionality. The `getCustomerPricing()` function creates a clean customer-safe data structure that excludes sensitive cost information. No security concerns identified.

### Performance Considerations

**✓ Performance Optimized** - The implementation uses efficient DOM manipulation patterns, proper CSS Grid for responsive layout, and minimal API calls by leveraging existing pricing data. Loading states provide good UX feedback. Minor optimization applied to reduce redundant function calls in availability checking.

### Final Status

**✓ Approved - Ready for Done**

This is a comprehensive, production-ready implementation that exceeds expectations. The product catalog provides an excellent foundation for the customer ordering system with professional design, solid architecture, and seamless integration. The developer demonstrated mastery of responsive design, security practices, and code organization standards.
