# Story 1.2: Customer Portal UI Framework

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** registered customer,  
**I want** a responsive portal interface with navigation,  
**so that** I can easily access ordering and account features on any device.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Customer portal loads with mobile-responsive design matching admin dashboard styling
2. Navigation menu provides access to Dashboard, Products, Orders, and Profile sections
3. Customer sees personalized welcome message with their name
4. Portal maintains visual consistency with existing Plaas Hoenders branding
5. Loading states and error messages follow existing admin dashboard patterns
6. Customer can navigate between sections without page refresh
7. Logout button is prominently accessible from all portal sections

**Integration Verification**:
- IV1: Admin dashboard styling and functionality remains unaffected by shared CSS
- IV2: Existing admin navigation and section switching continues to work properly
- IV3: Mobile responsiveness doesn't impact existing admin mobile layout

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: 1.1.customer-authentication-foundation.md#completion-notes]
- Customer authentication system is complete with JWT session management
- Customer portal entry point (customer.html) exists with basic authentication forms
- Customer.js contains authentication functions and session management
- Shared-utils.js provides common utilities for both admin and customer portals
- Database schema includes customer table with UUID primary keys and RLS policies

### Architecture Context
[Source: tech-stack.md]
- Frontend Framework: Vanilla JavaScript with ES6+ features
- CSS Framework: Custom CSS with Grid/Flexbox responsive design
- Icons: FontAwesome 6.0.0 for consistent icon usage
- Session Management: JWT tokens with localStorage persistence
- Database: Supabase with real-time subscription capabilities

### File Structure Context
[Source: source-tree.md]
- customer.html: Customer portal entry point (exists)
- customer.js: Customer-specific JavaScript functions (exists)
- shared-utils.js: Common utility functions (exists)
- styles.css: Shared styles extended for customer portal (exists)
- Admin files (index.html, script.js) must remain completely isolated

### Component Architecture
[Source: components.md#customer-portal-component]
**Customer Portal Component Responsibilities:**
- Customer-facing interface for registration, authentication, product browsing, order placement, and account management
- Key interfaces: Registration/login forms, product catalog, shopping cart, order history, profile management
- Dependencies: Supabase Auth, shared UI components, existing pricing data, email service integration
- Technology: Separate JavaScript file (customer.js), dedicated HTML entry point (customer.html), shared CSS framework

### Coding Standards
[Source: coding-standards.md]
- Function naming: camelCase with descriptive actions (customerLogin(), validateOrderData())
- CSS classes: kebab-case with component prefix (.customer-portal, .admin-dashboard)
- JSDoc documentation required for all public functions
- Error handling: Wrap all operations in try/catch with localStorage fallback
- Customer data isolation: Never expose cost prices, never show other customers' data
- Maintain existing admin functionality: Customer changes must not break admin dashboard

### UI Component Patterns
[Source: components.md#shared-ui-component-library]
- Common form components and validation patterns
- Card layouts and navigation patterns from existing admin dashboard
- Loading states and error handling following admin dashboard patterns
- Modal dialogs and notifications using existing styles
- FontAwesome icons for consistent visual language

### Security Requirements
[Source: Previous story dev-notes#security-requirements]
- JWT token validation before sensitive operations
- Customer data isolation via RLS policies
- Session timeout after 24 hours of inactivity
- Input validation for all customer interactions
- Never store passwords in localStorage - only JWT tokens

### Integration Constraints
[Source: epic-1-customer-order-portal.md#integration-requirements]
- Preserve ALL existing admin functionality without modification
- Maintain data consistency across customer and admin operations
- Utilize existing Supabase and Google Apps Script infrastructure
- No architectural changes to current admin system
- CSS extensions must not impact admin dashboard styling

### Testing Requirements
[Source: Previous story completion notes]
- Manual testing following existing admin dashboard patterns
- Test customer portal in isolation and alongside admin dashboard
- Verify customer data isolation and session management
- Test responsive design across mobile and desktop devices
- Validate all navigation flows and error handling scenarios
