## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: 1.4.shopping-cart-and-order-placement.md#completion-notes]
- Email queue integration already implemented via addOrderToEmailQueue() function in customer-portal.js:867
- Google Apps Script email system working with existing template structure
- Order placement system generates proper order IDs and customer data for email templates
- Customer portal creates orders with source="customer_portal" for proper admin dashboard integration
- Cart persistence and order data structures ready for email template population

### Email Service Architecture Context
[Source: architecture/external-apis.md#google-apps-script-api]
- Existing Google Apps Script endpoint: https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbzBN3lIbR-ZW9ybqb5E6e0XNa7wdrfKmO8d6pQeSVXAd0WM7tT-n9M4jFO42mC1vcS1/exec
- Rate limits: 20,000 triggers/day, sufficient for expected customer email volume
- Authentication: None required (public web app endpoint)
- Integration: Existing sendEmailViaGoogleScript() function in script.js for admin emails

### Database Schema Integration
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md#email-queue-extension]
- Email queue table extended with customer_id and email_type fields
- email_type values: 'admin_notification', 'customer_confirmation', 'status_update', 'password_reset'
- Customer ID linking available for tracking customer-specific email history
- Indexes added for efficient customer email queries

### Customer Data Model Context
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#customer + order]
- Customer table includes: id, email, name, phone, address, communicationPreferences
- Order table extended with: customer_id, source, status, customerEmail fields
- OrderItem table provides: productName, quantity, weightKg, unitPricePerKg, lineTotal for email itemization
- communicationPreferences JSON field controls customer email settings

### File Structure Context
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md + existing files]
- customer-portal.js: Contains existing order placement and email queue integration
- script.js: Contains sendEmailViaGoogleScript() function for email delivery
- shared-utils.js: Common utility functions available for email processing
- GoogleAppsScript.gs: Email service configuration and template handling
- Customer portal completely separated from admin dashboard files

### Email Template Requirements
[Source: CLAUDE.md#email-template-formatting-fix]
- Afrikaans template format established with proper banking details
- HTML formatting required: Convert line breaks to <br> tags for proper email display
- Template variables: {customerName}, {orderNumber}, {productName}, {quantity}, {total}
- Banking details: CAPITEC - Adriaan Bester, Rek no:2258491149, Savings/Spaar rek
- Email service: Google Apps Script (no Gmail API complexity)

### Component Architecture
[Source: architecture/components.md#email-service-component]
**Email Service Component Responsibilities:**
- Customer order confirmation emails
- Admin notification emails (unchanged)
- Email queue management (extended for customer types)
- Template processing for different email types
- Google Apps Script HTTP service integration

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]
- JSDoc documentation required for all email functions
- Error handling: Wrap all email operations in try/catch with logging
- Email queue integration: Use existing patterns, extend don't replace
- Customer data isolation: Only customer's own email data accessible
- localStorage backup: Email queue operations must have fallback handling
- Function naming: camelCase with descriptive actions (sendCustomerConfirmation(), resendOrderEmail())

### Database Integration Pattern
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md#order-items + email-queue]
- OrderItems table provides detailed product data for email itemization
- Email queue integration with customer_id and email_type fields
- Customer sessions for authentication validation before email resend
- Row Level Security policies ensure customers only access own email history

### Security Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules + database-schema.md#rls]
- JWT token validation before email resend operations
- Customer can only resend emails for their own orders
- Email addresses validated before sending confirmations
- No exposure of cost price data in customer email templates
- Row Level Security policies prevent cross-customer email access

### Integration Constraints
[Source: epic-1-customer-order-portal.md#integration-requirements]
- Preserve ALL existing admin email functionality without modification
- Customer emails must integrate with existing Google Apps Script service
- Email queue system extended to handle both admin and customer email types
- Maintain existing email template patterns and Afrikaans language support
- Customer email system must not impact admin dashboard email performance

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#manual-testing]
- Test email functions through browser console before integration
- Verify error handling with failed Google Apps Script responses
- Validate email template rendering with actual order data
- Test email resend functionality with expired sessions and invalid orders
- Ensure admin email functionality continues working after customer email integration

### Performance Considerations
- Email delivery performed asynchronously to prevent order placement delays
- Failed email delivery logged but doesn't block order creation success
- Email queue processing remains efficient with customer email additions
- Google Apps Script rate limits monitored for combined admin/customer volume
- Email template generation optimized for quick processing
