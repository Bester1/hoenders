## Story
**As a** customer with previous orders,  
**I want** to view my order history and current order status,  
**so that** I can track deliveries and reorder favorite products.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Standard Orders:**

1. Customer sees complete order history including pre-portal orders (matched by name/email)
2. Orders display with date, items, quantities, total amount, and current status
3. Order status updates reflect admin dashboard status changes in real-time
4. Customer can view detailed breakdown of individual orders
5. Order history is sorted chronologically with most recent first
6. Customer can filter orders by status (pending, confirmed, delivered, etc.)
7. Reorder functionality allows quick repeat purchases with quantity adjustments

**Group Order History:**

8. Group orders are clearly marked with "👥 Group Order" indicator and participant count
9. Group order summary shows total value and number of people
10. Customer can expand group orders to see breakdown by person
11. Reorder from group orders allows customer to recreate the full group structure
12. Group order status applies to entire group (all participants get same delivery status)
13. Individual invoices from group orders are accessible via "Download Invoices" button
14. Group order history shows coordinator role clearly for future reference

**Integration Verification:**

- IV1: Admin order status updates immediately reflect in customer portal

### Security and Data Isolation
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md#row-level-security]
- Row Level Security policies enforce customer data isolation
- Customers can only view orders where customer_id matches their authenticated user
- Historical order matching via match_customer_orders() function maintains security
- JWT token validation required before order history access
- Customer sessions tracked for security and audit purposes

### Coding Standards Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules + jsdoc]
- JSDoc documentation required for all order history functions
- Customer data isolation mandatory - never expose other customers' orders
- Error handling with try/catch and localStorage fallback patterns
- Maintain existing UI patterns and CSS classes from admin dashboard
- Real-time subscription error handling for connection failures

### Integration Constraints
[Source: epic-1-customer-order-portal.md#integration-requirements]
- Preserve ALL existing admin order management functionality
- Customer order history must integrate with existing admin dashboard without modifications
- Real-time updates must not impact admin dashboard performance
- Customer filtering and sorting must be independent of admin operations
- Group order history must maintain referential integrity with individual participants

### Performance Considerations
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md#customer-order-summary]
- Customer_order_summary materialized view available for optimized history queries
- Real-time subscriptions limited to customer's own orders only
- Order history pagination recommended for customers with many orders
- Group order participant data efficiently structured for display expansion
- Indexes on customer_id, order_date, status for fast order history queries

## Testing

### Manual Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#manual-testing]
- Test order history display through browser console with actual customer data
- Verify real-time status updates by changing order status in admin dashboard
- Validate customer data isolation by attempting to access other customers' orders
- Test reorder functionality with various product combinations and quantities
- Ensure offline functionality with localStorage when Supabase connection fails

### Integration Testing
- Customer order placement → Admin processing → Customer status update verification
- Historical order matching for customers with pre-portal orders
- Group order history display and participant breakdown functionality
- Real-time sync between admin dashboard and customer portal order status
- Customer filtering and sorting without admin dashboard impact
