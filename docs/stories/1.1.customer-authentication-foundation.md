# Story 1.1: Customer Authentication Foundation

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** potential customer,  
**I want** to register and login with email/password,  
**so that** I can access a personalized ordering experience.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Customer can register with email, password, name, phone, and address
2. Password is securely hashed using bcrypt before database storage  
3. Customer can login with email/password and receive JWT session token
4. Customer session persists across browser sessions via localStorage
5. Customer can logout and session is properly cleared
6. Registration validates email format and password strength
7. Login handles invalid credentials gracefully with user-friendly messages

**Integration Verification**:
- IV1: Admin dashboard login and functionality remains completely unchanged
- IV2: Existing Supabase database operations continue without interference  
- IV3: Customer authentication tables are isolated and don't impact existing order/import tables

## Dev Notes

### Database Schema Context
[Source: database-schema.md#customers]
- Use UUID primary keys with uuid_generate_v4() default
- Reference auth.users(id) with CASCADE delete for cleanup
- Include communication_preferences JSONB field for future expansion
- Required fields: name, email (unique), auth_user_id
- Optional fields: phone, address for delivery information
- Timestamps: created_at, last_login, updated_at with automatic triggers

### Authentication Architecture
[Source: tech-stack.md#authentication]
- Use Supabase Auth service for JWT token management
- Password hashing handled automatically by Supabase (bcrypt)
- Session tokens stored in localStorage for persistence
- No custom JWT validation needed - Supabase handles token verification

### Security Requirements  
[Source: security.md#authentication-authorization]
- NEVER store passwords in localStorage - only JWT tokens
- Always validate JWT token before sensitive operations  
- Customer can only access their own profile data via RLS policies
- Automatic logout after 24 hours of inactivity
- All customer inputs MUST be validated before Supabase operations

### File Structure
[Source: source-tree.md]
- Create customer.html as separate entry point from admin index.html
- Create customer.js for customer-specific JavaScript functions
- Extend styles.css with customer portal styling (maintain admin compatibility)
- Keep admin functionality completely isolated in existing files

### Coding Standards
[Source: coding-standards.md]
- Use camelCase function names: customerLogin(), customerRegister(), validateCustomerSession()
- Add comprehensive JSDoc documentation for all customer auth functions
- Include try/catch error handling for all Supabase operations
- Use existing CSS classes and UI patterns where possible
- NEVER expose cost prices or admin functionality to customer interface

### Integration Constraints
[Source: epic-1-customer-order-portal.md#integration-requirements]
- Preserve ALL existing admin functionality without modification
- Maintain data consistency across customer and admin operations
- Utilize existing Supabase and Google Apps Script infrastructure
- No architectural changes to current admin system

### Testing
[Source: coding-standards.md#testing]
- Manual testing following existing admin dashboard patterns
- Test authentication in both customer portal and admin dashboard
- Verify customer data isolation - customers cannot see other customer data
- Test session persistence across browser restarts and tab closures
- Validate all form inputs with both valid and invalid data
- Test graceful error handling for network failures and invalid credentials
