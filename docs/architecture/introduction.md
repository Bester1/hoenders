# Introduction

This document outlines the overall project architecture for Plaas Hoenders, including backend systems, shared services, and non-UI specific concerns. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency and adherence to chosen patterns and technologies.

**Relationship to Frontend Architecture:**
If the project includes a significant user interface, a separate Frontend Architecture Document will detail the frontend-specific design and MUST be used in conjunction with this document. Core technology stack choices documented herein (see "Tech Stack") are definitive for the entire project, including any frontend components.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

Based on my analysis of your existing Plaas Hoenders project, this is a **brownfield enhancement** to an existing, well-architected system. The project is NOT based on a starter template but rather extends a mature admin dashboard with sophisticated features:

**Existing Project Analysis**:
- **Current Architecture**: Vanilla JavaScript SPA with modular section-based navigation
- **Technology Foundation**: Static hosting (GitHub Pages), Supabase database, Google Apps Script integration
- **Mature Features**: OCR PDF processing, Business Intelligence analytics, email automation
- **Proven Patterns**: Dual-layer persistence, robust error handling, mobile-responsive design
- **Deployment Pipeline**: Git â†’ GitHub Pages with 2-5 minute deployment cycle

**Architectural Foundation**: The existing system provides excellent architectural patterns that will be extended rather than replaced. The customer portal will leverage existing infrastructure while adding new customer-facing components.

**No Starter Template Used**: The current system was built from scratch and has evolved into a sophisticated platform. The customer portal enhancement will follow established patterns rather than introducing external templates.
