# Security Update - Configuration Required

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Action Required After This Update

This security update moves sensitive API keys out of the codebase for protection. **The application will not work** until you configure your API keys.

### üîß Setup Instructions

1. **Copy the example config file:**
   ```bash
   cp config.example.js config.js
   ```

2. **Edit config.js with your actual API keys:**
   ```javascript
   const AppConfig = {
       SUPABASE_URL: 'your-actual-supabase-url',
       SUPABASE_ANON_KEY: 'your-actual-supabase-key', 
       GOOGLE_SCRIPT_URL: 'your-actual-google-script-url'
   };
   ```

3. **Your original keys** (from the old script.js):
   - Supabase URL: `https://ukdmlzuxgnjucwidsygj.supabase.co`
   - Supabase Key: `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...` (the full key from old script.js)
   - Google Script URL: `https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbzBN3lIbR-ZW9...` (your full URL)

### üîí Security Improvements Applied

- ‚úÖ **API Keys Protected**: No longer exposed in public repository
- ‚úÖ **XSS Prevention**: Replaced unsafe innerHTML with safe DOM manipulation
- ‚úÖ **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are now sanitized
- ‚úÖ **Error Handling**: User-friendly notifications for all errors
- ‚úÖ **Database Fallback**: Automatic localStorage fallback on connection issues

### üöÄ For GitHub Pages Deployment

Since config.js is now in .gitignore, you'll need to:

1. **Option 1**: Manually upload config.js to your hosting
2. **Option 2**: Use GitHub Actions with secrets (recommended for production)
3. **Option 3**: Use a server-side proxy for API calls

### üß™ Testing Locally

After creating config.js with your keys, the application should work exactly as before but with enhanced security.

### üì± User Experience Improvements

- Better error messages with user-friendly notifications
- Improved data validation and sanitization
- Enhanced loading states and error recovery
- Protected against malicious input injection

**Note**: The config.js file is automatically ignored by git and will never be committed, keeping your API keys safe.
